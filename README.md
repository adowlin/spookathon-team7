* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Hosting service used to manage the Git repositories.

**Resources**

* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create the site's wireframes.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for the [arrow down](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/angle-double-down?style=solid) and [arrow up](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/angle-double-up?style=solid) icons on the site's buttons.

## Testing

### Validation

#### HTML
* [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on the site. This validator does show warnings that headings are not used in any of the site's sections - this is to be expected as the lack of headers is by design to promote an immersive experience. No errors are present in the HTML code otherwise.

#### CSS
* [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate the CSS code in the style.css file. No errors are present.

#### Javascript
* [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the JavaScript code in the script.js file. No errors are present.
* [Esprima](https://esprima.org/demo/validate.html) was also used to validate the JavaScript syntax. Returned result: "Code is syntactically valid".

### Compatibility & Responsiveness
The site was tested across multiple browsers and device types, with no cross-browser compatibility issues to note.

* Browsers tested:
    * Chrome (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android)
    * Safari (macOS, iOS)
    * Microsoft Edge (Windows, macOS)
    * Firefox (Windows, macOS)
    * Samsung Browser (Android)

The site is mostly responsive across a wide range of device sizes. The fog overlay does not scale to cover the entire viewport height on smaller screen sizes, so gaps in the fog are present at the top and bottom of each site section. A fix may be implemented for this in future, but for now it is a known issue due to time constraints. However, this issue does not detract from the story's immersiveness.

### Manual Testing

Manual testing was performed on the following elements that appear on all sections of the site, to ensure all are working as expected;

* Fog: overly images appear and animate on all pages where implemented.


#### Title Page:
* Animated bats spawn and flutter across the screen as expected.
* Interactive Owl displays text and plays hooting sound effects on click as expected.
* "Begin Story" button scrolls to the next section and plays evil laugh sound effect as expected.

#### Story Section 1:
* Witch animation triggers transition across the screen and plays cackle sound effect.
* "Next Page" button scrolls to the next section of the story.

#### Story Section 2:
* Witch graphic animates on scroll to fly diagonally across the section.
* Moon graphic plays howling sound effect on click.
* "Next Page" button scrolls to section 3.

#### Story Section 3:
* Gravestones graphic slides up on scroll.
* Mouseover event on text plays haunting voice sound effect.
* "Next Page" button scrolls to section 4.

#### Story Section 4:
* Mouse enter & leave events on monster graphic magnify & shrink monster as expected.
* "About the Creators" button scrolls to the "About Us" section and plays "Happy Halloween" sound effect when clicked.
